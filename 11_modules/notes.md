# Modules

Same concept as JS

`main` === `index` (TBC)

can import file in folders by separating with `.`

Can also import using `from`. The order of this makes a lot more sense than others

all functions (`def`) are exported by default

the file that is read by the python processor has `__name__` of `__main__`

```py
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # do thing
```
